      <div class="section-body">
        <p>I am a graduate student in the Quantitative Economics program at the University of Pittsburgh, and will be finishing my master's degree in April 2021. My capstone project will involve working with the Pittsburgh Penguins to model appropriate salaries for minor league hockey players.</p>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 2017 with bachelor's degrees in economics and geology. As an undergraduate, I studied abroad at Sophia University in Tokyo, Japan on a Nationality Room Scholarship and participated in research as a Pitt Honors College fellow.</p>
        <p>Since graduation, I have worked in various positions from urban gardener to expense report auditor, but I soon hope to be gainfully employed in the field of data analytics. In addition to economics and programming, I am passionate about plants, fish, and rocks. </p>

    <div class="col-12 section-body">
      <p>Between work and studies, I make sure to dedicate what time I can to my interests and hobbies. I maintain three aquariums in my home, ranging from a 5 gallon inhabited by snails and a carnivorous pea puffer named Petunia to a 75 gallon filled with a lively community of pearl gourami, neon tetras, bristlenose pleco catfish, and a betta. I am an avid reader when I can be, and very much enjoy classic fantasy by Terry Pratchett and J.R.R. Tolkien, as well as some more contemporary works. When the world is not in lockdown, I go bouldering a few times a week to stay relatively in shape - but when in quarantine, I convince myself that high-octane virtual reality is a suitable stand-in.</p>
      <p>In the end though, I consider continuing my education more of a hobby than a chore, and spend a great deal of time branching off from my academic roots to teach myself web design and development, 3D modelling, and more.</p>

    <div class="col-12 section-body">
      <p>After graduation, I found a new passion in coding. I discovered this passion after completing my bachelor degrees. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and Python over the course of about a year through small projects (and a lot of Googling!). More recently, I've also acquainted myself with JavaScript and R, with some of the aforementioned beginner projects expressed in multiple languages. My progress is ongoing, and I am quite willing and eager to pick up more languages and technical knowledge in the future.</p>
      <p>As side projects, I'd like to get into web development and eventually into game development with Unreal Engine. I'm currently learning Blender for creating character models and in-game assets and textures.</p>

      <div class="section-body">
        <p>When I find the time, I like to draw. My preferred medium is digital, usually using Photoshop and an art tablet. I have done some simple pieces for friends in the past, but mostly I create for my own pleasure. I aim to further hone my technique (particularly with color) and eventually create game assets. I'd like to become more comfortable in my own style so that I can produce at a more consistent clip.</p>
